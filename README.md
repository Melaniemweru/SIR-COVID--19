# SIR-COVID--19
This project simulates COVID-19 spread in Kenya using the SIR model, analyzing infection dynamics and vaccination impact. It explores disease progression, models interventions, and assesses how vaccinating 20% of the population alters the outbreak. The goal is to visualize trends and highlight key public health strategies.
